With a strong interest in using data exploration and visualization methods to understand health issues, I Developed an interactive application to examine the Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset with the goal of advancing data analysis techniques and supporting medical research.

This Python script uses Streamlit to create an interactive web application for exploring the Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset. It loads the dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and allows users to visualize the data in different ways.

The main features of the application include:

Dataset Overview: Displays summary statistics and a few sample rows of the dataset.
Data Visualization: Offers various visualization options including count plot for death events, correlation heatmap, scatter plot for age vs serum creatinine, pair plot for selected features, and box plot for selected features.
About Section: Provides information about the dataset source, project purpose, and how to explore the dataset using the application.

We can interactively select different visualization options from the sidebar to gain insights into the heart failure clinical records
