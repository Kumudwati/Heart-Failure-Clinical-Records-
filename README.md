Streamlit App Link for HeartðŸ«€ Failure Clinical Records Analysis -   https://heart-failure-clinical-records.streamlit.app/

Introduction:

With a strong interest in using data exploration and visualization methods to understand health issues, this interactive application was developed to examine the Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset. The goal is to advance data analysis techniques and support medical research by providing an intuitive platform for exploring and analyzing the dataset.

Domain Problem Characterization:


The problem addressed by this application revolves around understanding heart failure clinical records and identifying predictive factors associated with patient outcomes. By analyzing various clinical features and their relationships with death events, the application aims to provide insights into the complexities of heart failure and support medical professionals in making informed decisions.

Data/Operation Abstraction Design:

The dataset used in this application is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of clinical records collected from patients during their follow-up period, encompassing essential parameters such as age, blood-related metrics, medical conditions, and survival outcomes. The data preparation involves loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame, selecting relevant columns, and handling missing values. This ensures that the dataset is ready for exploration and analysis within the application.


Future Work : 

To further enhance the capabilities of the application and deepen the analysis of heart failure clinical records, several avenues for future work are identified:


Integration of Machine Learning Models: Incorporating predictive modeling techniques to forecast patient outcomes and identify risk factors more accurately.

Enhanced Interactivity: Adding features for user-driven analysis, such as filtering based on specific criteria or interactive data manipulation.

Expansion of Visualization Options: Introducing additional visualization types to explore complex relationships within the dataset.

Integration with External Data Sources: Incorporating supplementary data sources to enrich the analysis and provide comprehensive insights into heart failure

Continued development and refinement of the application will contribute to advancing our understanding of heart failure and ultimately improving patient care and outcomes.
